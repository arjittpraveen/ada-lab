|Experiment number|Description|
|:---:|---|
|1|Sort a given set of n integers using **Selection Sort** and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of $n > 5000$ and record the time taken to sort. **Plot a graph** of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using C/C++, how the brute force method works and its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.|
